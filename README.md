# React-native-web-cocktail-station
This is a fork of [brunolemos/react-native-web-monorepo](https://github.com/brunolemos/react-native-web-monorepo)
- Adoption of microservice architecture. 
    - `common-*` are MiniApps, while
    - MainApp is coded under `common`.
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/react-&-webpack.html) is in use.
- Exposing MiniApp's AppRouter enables seamless navigation from MainApp to MiniApps. 
    - Thanks to [React.Lazy](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html) and [react-router-v4](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/)
- Declaring core ContextProvider in MainApp allows both MiniApp and MainApp to consume the context.
    - Thanks to [React.createContext](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html#when-to-use-context)
    
## Roadmap
- Add web-mobile-stitched primitives in `packages/common/src/shared/primitives`
    - Demo stitching between [@material-ui/core](https://material-ui.com/) and [react-native-elements](https://react-native-elements.github.io/react-native-elements/);
    - Inspired by https://github.com/cloudle/ruui
- Add swagger / insomnia API spec
- Add code-gen helper
- Add storybook as third deliverable
- Add /docs

## Why I choose this name?
Having a cocktail station is a cool thing in coder's workplace.

A bartender who is standing behind her cocktail station can utilise a variety of alcohol, juice and soda to produce magical cocktails to serve oneâ€™s taste.

Meanwhile, developers who are using yarn-workspace can combine self-sustained modules / microservices / miniApp to produce amazing applications to deliver content in various platforms e.g. Mobile, Web, Storybook, etc

I am sure you can see the light here.

## Why I choose React Router?
My teammates in my former company and current company love it.

Most importantly, it provides adoption to both mobile and web.

## Why I choose Monorepo?
I need code management in microservice approach.

I need rampant code reuse.

## Why I choose react-native-web?
I see the limitation of ReactJS in future
- Idea of ReactJS is amazing. We manipulate the virtual dom and the rendering logic will be handled by ReactJS
- Yet, the abstraction of virtual dom is still not adequate, leaving its syntax too sticky to HTML

Meanwhile, ReactNative, accompanied by Metro and Expo, is now paving the path to allow cross-platform coding.

In short, comparing to ReactJS, which is typically regarded as rendering engine, ReactNative is the framework I need.

In the ecosystem of ReactNative, react-native-web is the most mature project.

## How to start development
1. Install dependency after `git clone`
    ```sh
    git remote rename origin template
    yarn
    cd packages/mobile/ios
    pod install
    cd -
    git remote add origin [your-project-git-repo]
    ```
2. Open a bash for web
    ```sh
    yarn workspace web start
    ```
3. Open a bash for mobile serving
    ```sh
    yarn workspace mobile start
    ```
4. Open a bash for launch native IDE
    1. launch XCode by `yarn xcode`
    2. Press run button, await until simulator launched
    3. launch Android studio by `yarn studio`
    4. Press run button, await until simulator launched
5. Enjoy

## How to create a new microservice 
### Example
- Assume `emma` is the bartendar. In her workspace, she will use `emma-service` as her packages' namespace.
- Assume her deliverables include a package of features namely login, logout, forget password, etc
    - such package (microservice / dependency) is widely perceived as identity access management, 
    - `common-identity-access-management` is the folder name for this new microservice
    - `@emma-services/common-identity-access-management` is the package name
- Bartendar should create alias for each of her package with naming convention.
    -  **common-** making-a-claim for common service
    -  **mobile-specific-** step-counter for mobile-specific service
    -  **web-specific-** making-app-offline for web-specific service
    
### Steps
1. Make directory on project root
    ```sh
    mkdir -p packages/common-identity-access-management/ && cd "$_"
    mkdir src
    touch package.json tsconfig.json .gitignore src/App.tsx
    ```
2. Edit service's `package.json`
    ```json
    {
      "name": "@emma-services/common-identity-access-management",
      "version": "0.0.1",
      "private": true
    }
    ```
3. Edit service's `tsconfig.json`
    ```json
    {
      "extends": "../../tsconfig.base.json",
      "compilerOptions": {
        "composite": true,
        "declaration": true,
        "emitDeclarationOnly": true,
        "isolatedModules": false,
        "outDir": "dist",
        "rootDir": "src",
        "typeRoots": [
          "@types",
          "../../node_modules/@types"
        ]
      },
      "references": [
        {
          "path": "../common"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
4. Edit service's `.gitignore`
    ```
    *.jsbundle
    *.tsbuildinfo
    .DS_Store
    .history
    .jest
    .vscode
    build
    coverage
    dist
    node_modules
    npm-debug.log*
    yarn-debug.log*
    yarn-error.log* 
    ```
5. Link microservice workspace
    ```
    yarn
    ```
6. Link mobile project by editting `packages/mobile/package.json`
    ```json
    {
        "dependencies": {
          "@emma-services/common": "0.0.1",
          "@emma-services/common-identity-access-management": "0.0.1",
        }
    }
    ```
7. Link web project by editting `packages/web/config-overrides.js`
    ```js
    const appIncludes = [
        // Main App
        resolveApp('src'),
        // Mini App
        resolveApp('../common/src'),
        resolveApp('../common-identity-access-management/src'),
    ]
    ```
